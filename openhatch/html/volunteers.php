      <h2>THIS IS THE VOLUNTEERS PAGE</h2>
      Informational session, next Thursday in Example Building room 100! We will order
      10 Hawaiian pizzas for this event, as we always do. It's a little bit strange how 
      people at Example University always eat the same pizza! The purpose of this event will be 
      to determine what the next project Open Hatch will throw it's resources at will be.
      As many of you know, the latest project is coming to a close and will be showcased soon,
      and some great suggestions for the next project must be discussed. This event will
      narrow down the suggestions to just a handful, which will be sent out as a survey to 
      be voted on by members of Open Hatch.

      <h2>Informational Session</h2>
      Come to learn more about Open Hatch! We will be ordering 10 Hawaiian pizzas and discussing
      what Open Hatch does and how it relates to those on campus and in the community. This event
      will take place next Wednesday just after the campus bells ring in Example Lecture
      Hall room 9009! Come take part in a great meeting in the best room on campus. This is a 
      free event with Hawaiian pizza, so what are you waiting for? If you have ever wanted
      to build programming and communication skills, this is the event for you. Learn how 
      Open Hatch contributes to communities and open-source projects around the world
      by dedicating some of the best people around to working, learning, and collaborating together
      on real-world projects that provide valuable experience.

      <h2>Budget Meeting</h2>
      The Thursday after next next Thursday, members of Open Hatch will be meeting to discuss
      the current budget and how we can continue to keep the program thriving. While eating 
      10 Hawaiian pizzas, we will discuss many things, including whether or not having 10
      Hawaiian pizzas at every event is a waste of money. We will also talk about whether or
      not we have been having to many meetings, or if printing surveys for newcomers to the meetings
      on Egyptian Silk could also be a waste of money. We will also go over the transaction 
      tracker for the last few weeks, and discuss if it continues to be appropriate to allow
      members of Open Hatch to use credit cards connected to the program's budget for their
      personal coffee and food consumption. Even if you aren't a member, feel free to come 
      and start being more involved in Open Hatch!

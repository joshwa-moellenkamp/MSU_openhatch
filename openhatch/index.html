    <div id="about"><a class="link" href="http://openhatch.org">Open Hatch</a> is a non-profit organization 
      that seeks to match open-source software contributors with communities, tools, and education. 
      At <a class="link" href="http://campus.openhatch.org">Montana State</a>, this means networking connections and valuable experience for faculty 
      and students alike. We don't have any current projects underway, but we'd love suggestions!

      of your own!
